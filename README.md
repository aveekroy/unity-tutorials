> Scene view and Game view

In the center of the default Unity Editor layout is the Scene view. This is your interactive window into the world you are creating. You’ll use the Scene view to manipulate objects and view them from various angles.
In the default layout, the Game view also appears in this area; you’ll use the Game view to playtest your game.

> Hierarchy window

The Hierarchy is where you can organize all the things in your project. These things are called GameObjects.
If you add a GameObject to your project in Scene view, it will be listed in the Hierarchy. If you delete a GameObject from the scene, it will no longer be listed.

> Project window

The Project window is where you can find all the files (assets) available for use in your project, whether you use them or not.
The Project window works like a file explorer, organized in folders. You can drag assets directly from the Project window into the Scene view to add them to the scene.
Note the difference between the Project and Hierarchy windows: the Hierarchy contains all the GameObjects in the current scene, and the Project window contains all the assets available to your entire project.

> Inspector window

The Inspector is where you’ll find and configure detailed information about GameObjects.
When you select a GameObject in Scene view or in the Hierarchy, you’ll see its components in the Inspector. Components describe the properties and behaviors of GameObjects.

> Toolbar

The Toolbar is always at the top of the Unity Editor interface. Use the toolbar buttons to select and adjust GameObjects, change your point of view in the scene, and start and stop Play Mode.

#### Tips and Tricks

> Duplicating a GameObject on Heirarchy - Cmd+D

> BoxCollider - Used for applying physics for collision betweeen GameObjects

> RigidBody - Used for applying Gravity on a GameObject

> MeshRenderer - Used for rendering the gameobject (present as default case)

> Materials - Applying colors to GameObjects
